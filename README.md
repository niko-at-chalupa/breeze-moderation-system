> [!NOTE]
> This is still being worked on! Breeze's API will change significantly, so don't assume your stuff will continue working after an update

## introduction
Breeze is a moderation system meant to both provide tools for moderators to moderate their server and to automatically block certain words in the chat.

While Breeze comes with its own automatic word blocking handler *(which blocks profane words)*, Breeze comes with an extension system so you can write your own code **to make it adapt to *your* rules**.

# setup
1. Download the latest .whl from [releases](https://github.com/niko-at-chalupa/kheremara-breeze/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

2. Copy the downloaded .whl into the plugins/ folder of your server, and breeze does the rest
